An easy to use solution for allowing manager users to ask for help or support inside the MODX manager.
Clicking on the big info button in the top right section in the manager shows a help form popup where the user can describe their problem/question.
In addition to the form fields the username, user IP address, manager page URL and browser version is sent along.
After submission the form gets sent to a (configurable) email address where all the data is submitted data is shown in the email body.
Ideal for use in combination with email-to-ticket functionality in support ticket systems like Zendesk, Freshdesk or JIRA.

Configuration
---------------------------------------
ClientSupport is easy to set up and will work perfectly out of the box.
You can however customize the email to address, email from address, email from name, email template and the branding for the support ticket system via System settings.
