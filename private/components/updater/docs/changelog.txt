IMPORTANT: there was a severe bug up to version 0.2.4-beta, which prevents users from log in the manager ("permission denied" regardless of user permissions). This should be fixed from 0.2.7-beta on.
If you encounter this problem, you have to manually deactivate the plugin "Updater notifier" via the database (instructions and further information can be found at http://forums.modx.com/thread/?thread=96613&page=2).
If you still have this problem with version 0.2.7+, please write to modx-updater@seda.digital or post your problem at the forum thread.
